## Min and Max Event Dur

These fields can be used to limit the 'search' to events (transition pairs) having a minimum and/or a maximum duration.

They can be left blank, in which case no 'candidate' transition pairs will be 'filtered'.

Either one can have a positive non-zero value, in which case 'candidate' transition pairs that don't meet the 'filter' criteria will be skipped.

If both Min and Max event duration limits are provided, then Min < Max will be enforced.

## How to zoom, pan, and restore a plot

##### To restore a plot to it's unzoomed and unpanned state ---

    Right-click anywhere in the plot area
    
##### To pan ---

    For Mac:     Hold down the 'command' key
    For Windows: Hold down the 'control' key
    
    then left-click and drag

##### To zoom using the scrollwheel ---

    Put the cursor in either the plot area or in an axis.
    
    Rolling the scrollwheel will zoom (or shrink) around
    the cursor position.
    
##### To zoom by creating a selection window ---

    Note: all drag movements must be down and/or to the right.
    
    Place the cursor in either the plot area or in an axis.
    
    Hold the left mouse button down and drag to create a
    visible selection window.  Release the mouse button
    to activate the zoom.
    
##### Hovering over a data point ---

    Placing your cursor on a data point will cause its
    coordinate values to be reported below the plot.
    
##### Helpful hint ----

    A 'fresh' plot --- meaning one that has not been panned
    or zoomed --- is in an 'autoscale' state.  In this state,
    plotting new data (for example, when you are generating
    artificial data for test and learning purposes) will
    cause the x and y axis to readjust to the new data.
    
    If you want to set a fixed scale for plots, do a small
    'pan' (or 'zoom').  Any amount of 'pan' or 'zoom' will 
    put the plot into a fixed x and y scale condition that
    is quite useful for experiments.

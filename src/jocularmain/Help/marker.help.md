## Marker Selection

### Overview ---

**<font color=blue>Trim markers</font>** (color coded blue) are used to tell Jocular which observation points are to be excluded from the solution process. None, one, or both of these markers can be specified. Points to the left of the left trim marker are excluded while points to the right of the right trim are excluded.

**<font color=red>D limit markers</font>** (color coded red) bracket points that Jocular is to consider as candidate solution D transition points.

**<font color=green>R limit markers</font>** (color coded green) bracket points that Jocular is to consider as candidate solution R transition points.

#### Note ---

    When placing your cursor to select a marker position, put it
    in a clear area.  If you put it on a data point, that data point
    captures the mouse event (so that it can display the coordinate
    values for you) and so will not respond to a mouse click intended
    to place a marker.
     
#### Standard workflow ---

It is expected that you will place the desired markers from left to right. To help with this process, as each marker is placed, the next one to the right will be automatically selected. To terminate the process, click the **None** radio button (if necessary).

The usual procedure is to click (select) the radio button that corresponds to the first marker to be placed, then left-clicking in the plot area at the desired position for the currently selected *marker* and continuing in this manner from left to right.

#### Adjusting a marker a marker position ---

Click the radio button that corresponds to the marker that is to be adjusted, then left-click at the desired new position.

#### Deleting a marker ---

Click the radio button that corresponds to the marker that is to be removed completely, then click the **Erase Selected Marker** button, then click the **None** radio button. 

#### Temporarily hiding marker ---

To reduce visual clutter, the markers may be hidden by clicking the **Hide/Unhide** button. The markers remain effective whether or not they are hidden from sight.

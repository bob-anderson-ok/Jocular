## Baseline and Event Noise

The calculation of a 'fit' to an observation requires an accurate estimate of the observation noise prior to the occultation (baseline noise, often referred to as  sigmaB) and the observation noise during the occultation (event noise, often referred to as sigmaA).

At a minimum, the **Baseline Noise** must be provided.

If **EventNoise** is left empty, it will be automatically filled with the **Baseline Noise** value when a calculation of candidate solutions is started. It is recommended that **Event Noise** be left blank whenever there is not a clearly visible zone of reduced noise or the event 'bottom' is not easily determined.

It is *not* expected that either of these values will be filled in manually, although that is possible.  Instead, it is expected that the tools provided in the *Operations* menu will be applied to the observation data using chart markers to delineate points to be included in the estimation.
